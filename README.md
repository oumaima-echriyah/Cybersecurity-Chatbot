# Combining Diffusion Models and Language Understanding Models in a Cybersecurity Chatbot with Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Using a Microservices Architecture in a DevOps/MLOps Context

## Introduction
This project aims to enhance cybersecurity through a chatbot powered by Diffusion Models and Language Understanding Models. By integrating Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and utilizing a microservices architecture in a DevOps/MLOps context, we aim to provide an efficient, scalable, and intelligent chatbot solution for real-time cybersecurity threat management.

Key components of the project include:
- Diffusion Models for advanced generative capabilities.
- Language Understanding Models for effective user interaction.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve response relevance.
- Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
- DevOps/MLOps practices for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

## Tasks Completed by Team Members

### Oumaima Echriyah
**Roles:** LLMs Responsible, Backend Developer, Frontend Developer

**LLMs Responsible:**
- Developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system specifically for cybersecurity topics.
- Collected PDF datasets related to cybersecurity from trusted sources.
- Utilized **Python** for RAG system development.
- Integrated **Gemini** as the Language Model and **FAISS** as the Vector Database.
- Ensured accurate data indexing and retrieval.
- Key Functions for RAG:
    - `initialize_model`: Initializes the Gemini model with a specified configuration.
    - `load_vector_db`: Loads the FAISS vector database for similarity searches.
    - `get_conversational_chain`: Creates a conversational chain with predefined prompts.
    - `ask`: Handles user queries, retrieves relevant data, and generates responses.


**Backend Developer:**
- Developed a **Flask API** for seamless interaction with the RAG system.


*Example usage screenshot via Postman will be added.*

**Frontend Developer:**
- Developed an Angular-based **chat interface** for the cybersecurity chatbot.
- Enabled users to ask cybersecurity-related questions interactively.
- Ensured clear error handling for queries unrelated to the cybersecurity dataset.
- Designed a user-friendly interface similar to modern chatbot designs.
